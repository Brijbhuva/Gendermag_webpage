## GenderMagRecordersAssistant

## What is GenderMagRecordersAssistant?

Software is not gender-inclusive(https://theblog.adobe.com/inclusion-doesnt-stop-accessibility/, http://qi.ucsd.edu/events/event.php?id=2843).  So, how can we address that?  

If you want to help make software gender-inclusive, one way is to contribute to the GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant. 

The GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant is one tool to identify gender-inclusiveness issues in software. It is easy to use and can be used by software engineers to management to usability experts.

We welcome everyone with any background to contribute to making the world of software more gender inclusive.
    

## Goal of the GenderMag Recorders Assistant: 

GenderMag is a process you can use to find gender biases in user-facing software that you are designing/building. The GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant semi-automates using this process.

## How to use the Tool:
The GenderMag Cognitive Walkthrough specializes and streamlines the traditional cognitive walkthrough, incorporating explicit references to the five facets of gender inclusiveness:

- a user’s motivations for using the software,

- their information processing style,

- their computer self-efficacy,

- their attitude towards risk, &

- their ways of learning new technology. 

Through the GM Cognitive Walkthrough we can follow the process to find gender-inclusiveness issues. We can then fix the issues we find one at a time to remove barriers that may disproportionately affect one gender.

More about GenderMag:

At the GenderMag method’s core are five problem-solving facets that matter to software’s gender-inclusiveness. These facets are :
a user’s motivations for using the software,
their information processing style,
their computer self-efficacy,
their attitude towards risk, &
their ways of learning new technology.
The GenderMag method brings these facets to life with 4 personas (Tim, Abby, Patrick and Patricia), and sets the personas and facets into a simple, systematic process (The GenderMag Cognitive Walkthrough: http://gendermag.org, http://eusesconsortium.org/gender/GenderMagPersona-FoundationDocuments/Foundations.html).
