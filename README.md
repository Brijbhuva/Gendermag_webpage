## What is GenderMagRecordersAssistant?

Software is not gender-inclusive(https://theblog.adobe.com/inclusion-doesnt-stop-accessibility/, http://qi.ucsd.edu/events/event.php?id=2843).  So, how can we address that?  

If you want to help make software gender-inclusive, one way is to contribute to the GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant. 

The GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant is one tool to identify gender-inclusiveness issues in software. It is easy to use and can be used by software engineers to management to usability experts.

We welcome everyone with any background to contribute to making the world of software more gender inclusive.
